Greetings Blogchainers,

This is a test post to get **Blogchain** up and running. For those of you who haven't signed up for the club yet, feel free to do so at https://beinvolved.indiana.edu/organization/iubcc. For anyone looking to get more involved with our club feel free to email any of us:

- Noah Goldberg - negoldbe@iu.edu
- Allan Grudsky - agrudsky@iu.edu
- Sam Shi - samshi@iu.edu
- Zaeed Arif - zarif@iu.edu
- Arko Bhattacharyya - abhatta@iu.edu

You can expect weekly posts here about interesting articles or discussions we might come across about **any and all things blockchain**. Blogchain is a work in progress... I plan on implementing a commenting mechanism as soon as I have it figured out so that this can serve as more of an ongoing conversation between us all. However, if you have any questions, concerns, or opinions on anything you might come across on our site please do not hesitate to reach out. 

I hope at the very least that you enjoy the content.

Yours truly, 

-Ben
