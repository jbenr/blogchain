Blockchain’s applications in supply chain have always interested me, but I have never been able to find a good introduction article to exactly how it applies in supply chain and what it can do. I wrote this article to serve that purpose – starting with a brief introduction to supply chain and its problems, showing how blockchain can address them, and concluding with a case study showing it in action.

One of the main industries that blockchain technology is currently disrupting is real estate. Real estate transactions are relatively slow, tedious, and inefficient due to the size of the transaction taking place as well as the legal framework for these transactions. Real estate transactions have been held in person, with several intermediaries such as brokers and lawyers to help facilitate the transfer of assets.

With the development of smart contracts on the blockchain, these middlemen are no longer needed—a new possibility opens up where real estate can be tokenized, bought and sold more efficiently, more inexpensively, and more securely than ever. Smart contracts allow title deeds to be automatically transferred once all of the conditions of the smart contract are fulfilled (payment of the property). Take ATLANT, one of the blockchain platforms that allows users to buy and sell property by tokenizing property. As blockchain continues to develop, more platforms will arise allowing the sale of real estate directly on platform. And in the future, new real estate blockchain platforms can provide legal documentation support. 

Now, brokers and lawyers are no longer needed in the transaction, saving the client time and money and allowing them to get more value out of their purchase. Whereas before it might take days to complete a real estate transaction, now it could happen in a matter of minutes. And, there’s no need to meet in person, which is especially relevant during these times.

Because blockchain is decentralized, it would improve the security of real estate transactions; there is no single point of failure as all of the nodes in the network help validate transactions. In addition, smart contracts and blockchain are immutable, they cannot be changed, preventing tampering.
A fascinating feature that blockchain brings to the world of real estate is fractional ownership. Because real estate assets can now be tokenized, buyers can now own fractions of the property, which lowers the barrier to entry for real estate investors. Instead of having to buy the whole property to invest in it, investors can now have the option to buy a fraction of the property. Companies split their stock, thus lowering the price precisely for this reason. 

The advent of blockchain saw the introduction of a technology which will disrupt many industries improving the efficiency and security of sending valuable information, and cutting out the need for a middleman. Real estate is no exception, but we should keep in mind that before we see this disruption take place on a wider scale, we must wait for blockchain technology to continue to develop, and for regulations to catch up to the innovation taking place.
